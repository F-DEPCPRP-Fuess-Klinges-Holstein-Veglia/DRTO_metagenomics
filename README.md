The rapid spread of SCTLD throughout Florida’s Coral Reef has hampered efforts to
identify the causative pathogen, due in part to the difficulty of finding disease-susceptible
corals with no prior disease exposure. This project leveraged integrative multi-omic and
histological analyses to characterize SCTLD pathogenesis and coral immunity in four
species of coral collected from Dry Tortugas National Park before and after the arrival of
SCTLD. Histopathology of samples from this study showed consistent patterns to other
histological analyses of SCTLD, although healthy samples from the Dry Tortugas
exhibited an unusual amount of exocytosis. Initial analyses of coral microbial function and
taxonomy based on shotgun sequencing data suggest that while microbial communities of
corals naïve to SCTLD in Dry Tortugas National Park may differ from other corals sampled
in the Florida Keys, microbial community function and composition of diseased samples
from this study were similar to samples that have been previously sequenced. We found
that diseased coral samples across coral species harbored viruses hypothesized to interact
with the algal symbiont and viruses (including herpesvirus) that may influence host
immunity capacity against other infections. Immune function in samples of healthy coral
varied by species and patterns of change in function followed observed patterns of disease
prevalence by month. Continued analyses supported by Florida DEP will focus on the
development of robust, integrative analytical approaches to leverage the true power of this
data set.
